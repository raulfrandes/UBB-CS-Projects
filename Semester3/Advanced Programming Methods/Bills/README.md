# Bills App

**Bills App** is a small C# console project made for a university assignment. Its main purpose is to keep track of bills (invoices), documents, and purchases by reading data from simple text files.

With this app, you can:

- List all documents issued in 2023.
- See all bills that are due this month.
- Find bills with at least 3 products bought (taking quantity into account).
- List all purchases for bills in the “Utilities” category.
- Check which bill category had the highest spending.

The project is built using basic object-oriented principles, and all the data is loaded from text files—no database needed. It’s mostly meant to demonstrate how to work with collections, simple file parsing, and LINQ in C#.
