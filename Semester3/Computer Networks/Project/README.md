## Computer Networks â€“ Cisco Network Simulation Project

This project is a Cisco Packet Tracer simulation that reproduces a complex network topology as shown in the assignment diagram. The network includes multiple routers, switches, and hosts, and implements the following features:

- IP addressing and subnetting for multiple networks and VLANs
- DHCP server configuration for automatic IP assignment
- RIP routing protocol setup with a gateway of last resort
- NAT configuration for network address translation
- HTTP and DNS servers to simulate internet services
- VLAN configuration with at least two separate VLANs

The topology is designed to support different groups of hosts and services, with routing, switching, and service delivery according to the assignment requirements.
