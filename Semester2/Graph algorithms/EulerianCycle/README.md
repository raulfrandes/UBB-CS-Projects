# Eulerian cycle

For an undirected graph, the program finds an Eulerian cycle.

Input and output file paths are given as parameters on the command line, the first being the input file path and the second being the output file path.

### The input file

The input file contains on the first line 2 numbers separated by space V E where V represents the number of nodes of the graph and E represents the number of edges of the graph. The next E lines contain 2 numbers separated by space, each representing an edge, x y. Indexing of vertices starts at 0. The graphs in the input files are Eulerian

### The output file

The output file will contain a single line with the Eulerian cycle.
