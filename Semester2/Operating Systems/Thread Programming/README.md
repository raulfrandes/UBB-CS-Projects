 ## Exercises
1. Create a multithreaded C program that reads N integers from a binary file, processes them to find occurrences of prime numbers between 2 and 100, and analyzes these occurrences. After counting, each thread checks if its prime's occurrence is closest to the average and prints the result.

2. Create a multithreaded C program that reads `N` integers from a binary file and analyzes the frequency of each digit (0-9) as the last digit of the numbers. After counting, each thread checks if its digit's count is closest to the average and prints the result.

3. Develop a multithreaded C program that reads `N` integers from a binary file, processes them to count occurrences of even numbers between 2 and 100, and determines which number's occurrence is closest to the average. After counting, each thread calculates whether its number's occurrence is closest to the average and prints the results.

4. Create a multithreaded C program that reads `N` integers from a binary file and processes them to find the minimum difference between the average of subsets of the array and random numbers.
