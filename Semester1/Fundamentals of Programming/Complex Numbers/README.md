# Complex numbers console application

The program manages a list of complex numbers and allows the following actions to be performed repeatedly:

### 1. Add number to list
   - Add complex number to the end of the list
   - Insert complex number at a given position

### 2. Modify items in the list
   - Delete element at a given position
   - Deletes elements from a range of positions
   - Replaces all occurrences of a complex number with another complex number
 
### 3. Search numbers
   - Print the imaginary part for the numbers from a range of positions
   - Print all complex numbers whose modulus is less than 10
   - Print all complex numbers whose modulus is 10

### 4. Operations with the numbers in the list
   - The sum of the numbers in a given subsequence
   - The product of the numbers in a given subsequence
   - Print the list sorted in descending order by the imaginary part

### 5. Filter
   - Prime real part filtering - removes from the list the complex numbers where the real part is prime
   - Modulus filtering - removes from the list the complex numbers to which the modulus is <, = or > than a given number

### 6. Undo
   - Undo the last operation
